# V1
- persona + email update
  - fix broadcasting emails on page load
  - ensure that socket.io has the most recent version with emails
- tooltips

# V2 (needs changes to PeerJS library)
- serialize files asynchronously
- show progress bar for sender and recipient

# V3:
- set email from Persona on server side to avoid faking it
- send multiple files (one after another)
- allow to get room name from URL (provided or generated) for wan connections; don't get public IP in this case

# Firebase (?)
- use Firebase instead of socket.io for room server
  - initial vs new peers https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/firebase-talk/iZ3eLYAZBkU
- less hosting issues, but only max 50 connections on free plan...
